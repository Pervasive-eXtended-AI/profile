# Pervasive eXtended AI UM-Murdoch Research Lab                   
PXAI Lab is a joint initiative by Universiti Malaya and Murdoch University. We bring together researchers with different backgrounds and interests to pursue research at the crossroads of Artificial Intelligence, Edge Computer, IoT, HPC, eXtended Reality (XR), Telepresence Machine Learning and Pervasive computing.                
Research Lab focuses on the human-centred design, development, and evaluation of interactive technology spaning from Pervasive Artificial Intelligence (AI), Edge AI, human-machine collaboration, Future Telepresence, eXtended Reality (XR), and Immersive Visualization.                            
Our laboratory has an international and project driven nature. We are active in the design, development and coordination of national and international projects as well as industry-funded grants.                             
Members of PXAI Lab engage in the organization of educational and dissemination events, and in scientific and technological consulting on topics related to the laboratory research themes (non-exhaustive).
